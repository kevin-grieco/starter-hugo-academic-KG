**Summary** 

Sierra Leone was one of the last countries in the world to be affected by the pandemic but
has faced a series of institutional and operational challenges that have slowed down
response efforts to COVID-19. The government's preparedness from January was led by the
Ministry of Health and Sanitation, and then the EVD Emergency Operations Committee
(EOC) was reactivated in March, led by the Ministry of Defence. There remain issues around
coordination and evidence-led decision-making to resolve. Quickly following this was the
implementation of resource intensive approaches for quarantine and disease surveillance.
However, given the rapid increase in cases this has been unsustainable to maintain,
resulting in a lack of testing and insufficient support for COVID-19 patients and their families.

Unlike most other countries, Sierra Leone has not imposed an extended lockdown due to a
deep concern about the negative economic consequences of comprehensive restrictions on
economic activity. Instead, two 3-day lockdowns, policies of social distancing and a ban on
inter-district travel have been implemented, although voluntary compliance rates seem low
and there is a lack of capacity to enforce these policies. As prolonged restrictions on
economic activity are unlikely, considerations should focus on how economic activities can
be modified during COVID-19 and how voluntary compliance can be supported.
The Response Communication Team has attempted to disseminate information on
prevention and treatment of COVID-19 that is tailored to different audiences. There has also
been an information campaign to encourage citizens to continue to seek medical care for
non-COVID-19 related diseases. However, non-COVID-19 health services have been
affected by the pandemic's onset, as the government has reallocated already insufficient
personnel to fight the virus. There is reason to believe that this reallocation of resources will
disproportionately affect women and children. Given this concern, there is insufficient
consideration towards Gender and Social Inclusion (GESI) in the response. Select initiatives
are however taking place to raise awareness on sexual and gender-based violence, ante-
natal healthcare, and gendered communication messaging (especially targeted at the
youth).

Non-health sectors have also been impacted by COVID-19. As schools have been closed
the government has attempted to continue education through distance learning. Social
distancing policies and nightly curfews greatly curtail business opportunities for many bars
and restaurants; the inter-district travel ban restricts the movement of supplies and foods
across the country. While there are some social protection mechanisms in place to combat
these economic challenges, overall social protection is limited. Both the government and
international organisations are looking to strengthen this over the next few months, as the
financial impact of the pandemic is felt by the poorest and most vulnerable households.

This report comes at a time when Sierra Leone is on the edge of a new stage of the COVID-
19 response---first cases have been confirmed in most districts. The authors have tried to
translate a description of events into insights for external actors looking to support the
country's efforts to combat COVID-19, largely focusing on the operational aspects of the
COVID-19 response. Specifically, this report identifies entry points for the Maintains
programme in Sierra Leone, although these might also be useful to other actors in country.
