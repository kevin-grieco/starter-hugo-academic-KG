**Abstract** 

There is agreement in policy circles that governments in Sub-Saharan Africa--and governments of developing countries more generally--need to increase their share of ``own source'' revenue. How should governments in Sub-Saharan Africa do this? This report explores the potential for local governments to raise revenue through property taxation in rural areas. 

In many contexts, the primary variable cost associated with rural tax collection is the tax collector's transportation costs. Using property taxation in rural Sierra Leone (Kono District) as my case, I start by measuring village-level collection costs, obtaining quotes from motorbike drivers on the travel cost between a tax collector's residence and the set of villages for which a given collector is responsible. I estimate village level potential revenue with data on the number and type of building structures in each village. I then use simulation exercises to investigate net potential revenue under different assumptions regarding (1) compliance rates; (2) collector travel behavior; (3) whether collectors are compensated via a pay-for-performance model (i.e., tax farming) or with a flat salary.

I find that property taxation in poor, sparsely populated, rural areas can generate positive net revenues, but these gains are modest, especially when taking into consideration additional costs that are not fully captured in the simulations, relative to other revenue streams. Simulations also illuminate several characteristics of rural taxation that have policy implications. First, to increase net revenue, policy makers should prioritize increasing compliance over reducing collection costs. Second, much of the tax base lies in a small subset of the total villages. Third, the relative benefits of tax farming (vis-Ã -vis a flat salary) are conditional on tax farming generating higher taxpayer compliance: if compliance rates are held fixed, salary-based compensation models outperform tax farming models because tax-farming collectors (who must pay travel costs upfront) visit less villages. 

I conclude by situating these results in a policy makers broader calculus for taxing rural areas, where efficiently extracting resources may be only one of several motivations for taxation.
