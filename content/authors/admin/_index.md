I am a PhD Candidate in political science at UCLA where I am currently a 2023 Keck Graduate Fellow. I will be a predoctoral fellow at the [Local Government Revenue Initiative](https://logri.org/) starting in September 2023. 

I study the political economy of development, primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa. My current work focuses on fiscal capacity and traditional political institutions and I use methods of causal inference to address these topics. My research has been supported by the [International Growth Centre](https://www.theigc.org/) and the [International Centre for Tax and Development](https://www.ictd.ac/). I was a [C. Lowell Harris Dissertation Fellow](https://www.lincolninst.edu/c-lowell-harriss-dissertation-fellows-2021-2022) and I received a UCLA Dissertation Year Fellowship.
