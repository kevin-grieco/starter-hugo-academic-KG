**Abstract** 

How can weak states build fiscal capacity? In this article, I argue that governments can build fiscal capacity by establishing collaborative relationships with non-state political institutions that govern rural areas in many parts of the world. I provide empirical support for this argument with a field experiment I conducted in rural Sierra Leone. I embedded an experiment within a tax awareness video that I designed in conjunction with the local government in Kono district (KDC) and the district's paramount (i.e., highest ranking) chiefs-leaders of the relevant non-state political institutions in Sierra Leone. To identify the impacts of state collaboration with these traditional political institutions (TPIs) on citizens' compliance, I manipulated the presence of paramount chiefs in these videos and therefore property owners' beliefs about collaboration between local government and chiefs. I evaluated the impact of these videos using survey data collected from 1,752 property owners in 118 villages across five chiefdoms in Kono district. I find that the Collaboration Treatment increases a pre-registered index of tax compliance measures. In addition, I find that the Collaboration Treatment increases property owners' belief that they should pay taxes. To tease out whether TPI authority is driven by legitimacy or coercion, I created additional versions of the tax awareness video that manipulate the paramount chiefs' statements to emphasize either accountability mechanisms in TPIs or punishment for non-compliance (i.e., coercive mechanisms). To provide a thick description on what these mechanisms look like in my case, I pair this experimental data with qualitative data from 300 semi-structured interviews I conducted in 29 villages in my study area. I find experimental and qualitative evidence that TPIs' authority stems from both their legitimacy and coercive capacity. I argue, based on qualitative evidence, that legitimacy and coercion are complementary mechanisms of TPIs' authority enabling them to effectively enforce laws that have broad public support and are seen as socially beneficial.
