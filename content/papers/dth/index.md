abstract: Building durable fiscal capacity requires that the state obtains compliance with its tax demands, a struggle for weak states that lack enforcement capacity. One potential option for governments in weak states is to enhance their legitimacy and thereby foster voluntary compliance. In this study, we report results from a phone-based participatory budgeting policy experiment in Sierra Leone that attempted to increase legitimacy and tax compliance by inviting public participation in local policy decision-making. In phone-based town halls, participants shared policy preferences with neighbors and local politicians and then voted for local public services that were subsequently implemented. We find that the intervention durably increased participants' perceptions of government legitimacy. However, against influential models of tax compliance, we find a robust null effect on tax compliance behavior. In exploratory analyses, we document that partisan affiliation strongly conditions the interventions' effects on tax compliance behavior and attitudes towards paying taxes.

**Abstract**

While fiscal capacity is central for economic growth and political stability, many governments around the world struggle to effectively raise revenue through taxation. One influential argument about the historical development of fiscal capacity is that political leaders can induce voluntary tax compliance by expanding democratic institutions. In this project, we generate evidence to evaluate this theory in contemporary democracies using a large-scale field experiment to study the a participatory budgeting program implemented in Freetown, Sierra Leone. We estimate this intervention's impact on tax compliance (observed through administrative data) and political attitudes and behaviors, which we capture in three waves of surveys.

Contrary to theory and our expectations, we do not find that the participatory budgeting intervention, on average, increases tax compliance. This null effect is particularly striking given that we do find that the intervention (i) effectively creates opportunities for participants to communicate preferences to government officials (i.e., increases "voice") and (ii) increases satisfaction with City Council's service provision and improves perceptions of government responsiveness. However, the average null effect on compliance behavior masks substantial variation in the treatment effect conditional on partisan affiliation---while the intervention increases compliance for co-partisans, we see a backlash amongst non coparitsans. We conclude that attempts to increase compliance by extending opportunities for voice are ensnared in partisan politics.
