How can governments tailor tax bills to maximize tax compliance? A large literature has explored how communicating enforcement threats and service delivery achievements through tax messages influences compliance. Here, we provide novel evidence on previously understudied messaging strategies that convey the increased procedural fairness of tax collection in our setting. In our study, appeals to procedural fairness take two: first, one treatment group receives information on an appeals process. Second, another treatment group is made more aware of the switch from in-person tax collection – notoriously susceptible to collusion – to direct tax payments via banks. In this study, we collaborate with the Freetown City Council (FCC) to send different versions of Rate Demand Notice letters (RDNs)---the official property tax bill in our setting---to the universe of property owners in Freetown. Ultimately, this study seeks to demonstrate whether citizens reward their administration’s increased procedural fairness in tax collection with higher tax compliance.
